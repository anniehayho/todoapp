# Todo App Notification System

## Overview
The Todo App now includes a comprehensive notification system that allows users to receive reminders for their tasks at customizable intervals.

## Features

### Notification Timing Options
- **5 minutes before**: Get notified 5 minutes before your task starts
- **10 minutes before**: Get notified 10 minutes before your task starts  
- **15 minutes before**: Get notified 15 minutes before your task starts
- **When it's time**: Get notified exactly when your task begins

### Key Components

#### 1. NotificationService (`src/services/NotificationService.js`)
- Handles all notification scheduling and management
- Uses `react-native-push-notification` for local notifications
- Stores notification settings in AsyncStorage
- Manages notification permissions

#### 2. NotificationSettingsScreen (`src/screens/NotificationSettingsScreen/`)
- User interface for configuring notification preferences
- Toggle switches for each notification timing option
- Permission status display and request functionality
- Test notification feature

#### 3. Integration with Task Management
- **Task Creation**: Notifications are automatically scheduled when creating new tasks
- **Task Editing**: Notifications are rescheduled when editing existing tasks
- **Task Deletion**: Notifications are cleared when tasks are deleted

## How It Works

### 1. Setting Up Notifications
1. Navigate to Settings â†’ Notifications
2. Grant notification permissions when prompted
3. Configure your preferred reminder timings
4. Test notifications to ensure they work

### 2. Creating Tasks with Notifications
1. Create a new task with a specific date and time
2. Notifications are automatically scheduled based on your settings
3. You'll receive reminders according to your preferences

### 3. Managing Existing Tasks
- **Editing**: When you edit a task's time, notifications are automatically rescheduled
- **Deleting**: When you delete a task, all associated notifications are cleared
- **Completing**: Completed tasks retain their notifications until the scheduled time

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- `react-native-push-notification`: For local notifications
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`: For storing settings
- `moment`: For date/time manipulation

### Android Configuration
The app includes necessary Android permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
- `VIBRATE`: For notification vibration
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`: For notifications after device restart
- `WAKE_LOCK`: For reliable notification delivery

### iOS Configuration
iOS notifications work out of the box with the react-native-push-notification library.

## Usage Examples
